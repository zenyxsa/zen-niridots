### What is this?

zen-niridots is your entire desktop. The bar at the top, the dock, notifications, settings, wallpapers, all of it. Not a theme, not dotfiles you paste. A full shell that runs on Linux.

This project is a customized fork of [iNiR](https://github.com/snowarch/iNiR), adapted and maintained independently by zenyxsa.

### What do I need to run it?

A compositor. That's the thing that handles your windows and puts pixels on screen. zen-niridots is made for [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) (a tiling Wayland compositor). There's some old Hyprland code from when the original project was a fork of end-4's dots, but Niri is what the project is built around and tested with upstream.

The shell runs on [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/), a framework for building shells in QML (Qt's UI language). You don't need to know any of that to use it though, everything is configurable through the GUI or a JSON file.

### How it all connects

```text
your apps
   ↓
zen-niridots (shell: bar, sidebars, dock, notifications, settings...)
   ↓
Quickshell (runs QML shells)
   ↓
Niri (compositor: windows, rendering)
   ↓
Wayland → GPU
```

### Is it stable?

It's a personal project that grew into a complete desktop shell. The upstream iNiR project is used daily by its maintainers and community, but things can still break sometimes.

If something doesn't work, `inir doctor` can fix many common issues. The upstream Discord is also available for discussion and troubleshooting.

### Why does it exist?

zen-niridots exists as a customized fork of iNiR with changes maintained separately from upstream. The current focus is on customizing dependency handling and installation behavior for Arch Linux while keeping the rest of the iNiR desktop experience intact.

### Words you'll see around

* **Shell**: the UI layer (bar, panels, overlays)
* **Compositor**: manages windows, draws to screen (Niri, Hyprland, Sway...)
* **Wayland**: Linux display protocol (the new one, replaces X11)
* **QML**: Qt's declarative UI language, what zen-niridots is written in
* **Material You**: Google's color system that makes palettes from images (that's the auto-theming)
* **ii / waffle**: the two panel styles. ii = Material Design vibes, waffle = Windows 11 vibes. `Super+Shift+W` switches between them

> Not for low-spec machines.
> You can strip it down a lot though. Turn off effects, drop panels, flatten the design. Settings or `config.json`, whichever you prefer.

## Features

**Two panel families**, switchable on the fly with `Super+Shift+W`:

* **Material ii**: floating bar, sidebars, dock, and 8 visual styles (Material, Cards, Aurora, iNiR, Angel, Regalia, ZZZ, Cookie Shapes)
* **Waffle**: Windows 11-inspired taskbar, start menu, action center, notification center

**Automatic theming**. Pick a wallpaper and everything adapts:

* Shell colors via Material You, propagated to GTK3/4, Qt, terminals, Firefox, Discord, SDDM
* 10 theming targets covering terminals, editors, browsers, Spicetify, Steam, Cava and more
* Theme presets: Regalia / Regalia Ivory, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, Rosé Pine, and custom

**Built for Niri.** Hyprland code survives from the original fork but is not the primary tested compositor.

**Kira**, the mascot, lives on your desktop if you want her there. Off by default, art pack is a separate download.

## zen-niridots Changes

This fork currently focuses on Arch Linux customization while keeping the upstream iNiR experience and feature set.

### Current modifications

* Customized Arch Linux dependency definitions
* Customized Arch Linux installation behavior
* Independent maintenance of the fork under `zenyxsa/zen-niridots`

For upstream changes, feature development, and original project updates, see the [iNiR repository](https://github.com/snowarch/iNiR).

---

## Quick Start

Clone this fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenyxsa/zen-niridots.git
cd zen-niridots
./setup install
```

Interactive installation:

```bash
./setup install
```

Automatic installation:

```bash
./setup install -y
```

The installer handles dependencies, system config and theming. After install, run `inir run` to start the shell, or log out and back in.

```bash
inir run                        # launch the shell
inir settings                   # open settings
inir logs                       # check runtime logs
inir doctor                     # auto-diagnose and fix
inir update                     # pull + migrate + restart
```

Other ways in, if `./setup install` isn't what you want:

```bash
./setup                       # TUI menu, pick what you want
sudo make install             # system-wide instead of your home
./setup rollback              # undo the last update
```

> [!NOTE]
> The commands above use the standard iNiR command names. The fork does not currently rename the `inir` CLI itself.

**Distros:** Arch is the primary target for this fork. Fedora and Debian/Ubuntu also have automated dependency paths inherited from upstream; other distributions use the generic guidance in the [upstream package list](https://github.com/snowarch/iNiR/wiki/PACKAGES).

## Troubleshooting

```bash
inir logs                       # check recent runtime logs
inir restart                    # restart the active runtime
inir repair                     # doctor + restart + filtered log check
./setup doctor                  # auto-diagnose and fix common problems
./setup rollback                # undo the last update
```

Check [Limitations](https://github.com/snowarch/iNiR/wiki/LIMITATIONS) before opening an issue. If you'd rather just ask someone, the upstream Discord is available for discussion and support.
