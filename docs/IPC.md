# IPC Reference

iNiR exposes IPC targets you can call from Niri keybinds, scripts, or your terminal.

> **Quick discovery:** `inir help` lists all targets, `inir <target> --help` shows available functions.
> Shell completions: `eval "$(inir completions bash)"` (also zsh, fish).

From terminal (for testing, or showing off):

```bash
inir <target> <function>
```

In Niri config (for actual keybinds):

```kdl
bind "Key" { spawn "inir" "<target>" "<function>"; }
```

For low-level debugging, `inir ipc <target> <function>` still works.

---

## Available Targets

Everything iNiR can do, exposed for your scripting pleasure.

### dev

Development navigation for loading lazy surfaces and internal views without
automating pointer or keyboard input. Destination identifiers are stable and
returned as JSON by `list`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `list` | Return the destination inventory as JSON |
| `open` | Open a destination by semantic identifier |
| `close` | Close development-opened surfaces and clear the request |
| `current` | Return the current destination or `closed` |

```bash
inir dev list | jq -r '.[].id'
inir dev open sidebar-left/anime-schedule
inir dev close
inir dev audit
inir dev audit sidebar-left/ai settings/ai
inir dev audit --all --all-families
```

`inir dev audit` selects destinations related to changed area-specific files in
the current worktree. Destination arguments select an exact scope, while
`--all` requests every safe destination and `--all-families` includes both ii
and waffle. Each visited destination is closed again and new QML warnings or
errors are attributed to the destination that triggered them. Destructive
actions such as locking, recording, power commands, and wallpaper mutation are
excluded.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `toggleEditMode` | Toggle widget edit mode (drag, resize, configure desktop widgets) |
| `setEditMode enabled` | Set widget edit mode explicitly |
| `editState` | Report the active selection, physical panel insets, full desktop work area and panel-aware zone work area for each output |
| `desktopItemsState` | Report desktop-item persistence, availability, item count, validation errors and undo state |
| `focusWidget widgetName openControls` | Select a desktop widget and optionally open its quick controls |
| `promoteWidget widgetName` | Move a desktop widget to the top of the persistent layer order |
| `resetLayerOrder` | Reset desktop widgets to their built-in stacking order |
| `setWidgetEnabled widgetName enabled` | Enable or disable a built-in desktop widget |
| `clockDebugState` | Report clock palette, renderer and quick-control geometry diagnostics |
| `clockDebugSetMode digital\|cookie adaptToWallpaper` | Temporarily select a diagnostic clock mode |
| `clockDebugSetRegion color brightness spread` | Inject a temporary wallpaper-region sample |
| `clockDebugSetLayout x y quickControlsOpen` | Probe quick-control geometry at a hypothetical clock position without moving the widget |
| `clockDebugRestore` | Restore the config captured by clock diagnostics |

The mutating diagnostic functions require the supervised shell to be loaded
with `INIR_REGION_DEBUG=1`. They snapshot the clock's relevant config on first
use; always finish a diagnostic run with `clockDebugRestore` before removing
the environment flag.

```kdl
bind "Super+W" { spawn "inir" "background" "toggleEditMode"; }
```

| `create` | Create a new widget scaffold in the widgets directory |

### widgetpower

Desktop-widget power management (pauses widget rendering on game mode, fullscreen, present windows, or edit mode). Service: `services/WidgetPowerManager.qml`.

### recordingOsd

### autostart

Niri login autostart manager. Reads and writes the managed section of
`~/.config/niri/config.d/50-startup.kdl` (delimited by `// >>> inir-managed-autostart >>>` /
`// <<< inir-managed-autostart <<<`). Base iNiR lines and any hand-written
`spawn-at-startup` lines outside the markers are preserved verbatim; toggling an
entry comments the line out instead of deleting it. Safe no-op on non-Niri
compositors (the page shows a guard instead).

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Return `niri\|<path>\|<managedCount>\|<externalCount>\|<state>` |
| `addApp <desktopId>` | Append a managed `gtk-launch <desktopId>` entry |
| `addCommand <cmd>` | Append a managed `spawn-sh-at-startup` shell line |
| `removeLast` | Remove the last managed entry |
| `reload` | Force re-read the startup file |

The Settings UI (ii: AutostartConfig, waffle: WAutostartPage) is the primary
interface; these IPC calls exist for scripts/keybinds. Apps the user already
launches via hand-written lines outside the markers are detected and shown as
"External" (read-only) in the list.

---

## Standalone Commands

These are top-level `inir` commands that work directly, without going through IPC.

### colorpicker

Launch `hyprpicker` to pick a color from anywhere on the screen. The hex value is copied to the clipboard (`-a` flag).

```kdl
bind "Super+Shift+C" { spawn "inir" "colorpicker"; }
```

Requires `hyprpicker` installed.
