# Modules Catalog

UI components organized by panel family. Modules handle rendering and interaction. They don't own global state, they read from services and config singletons.

## How modules load

Every visible panel is wrapped in a `PanelLoader` inside either `ShellIiPanels.qml` (Material ii) or `ShellWafflePanels.qml` (Waffle). A panel loads when:

1. `Config.ready` is true
2. Its identifier is in the `enabledPanels` config array
3. Its `extraCondition` (if any) is satisfied

Users can disable any panel from Settings without touching config files.

## Material ii Panels

### Core

| Module | Panel ID | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `bar/` | `iiBar` | Top bar. Workspaces, clock, system indicators, tray, weather. ~35 QML files. |
| `verticalBar/` | `iiVerticalBar` | Vertical bar variant for left/right edge placement. |
| `dock/` | `iiDock` | Application dock. Supports all 4 edges (top/bottom/left/right). Scroll an icon to cycle that app's windows; `dock.notificationBadge` puts an app's pending notification count on its icon. |
| `background/` | `iiBackground` | Desktop wallpaper layer. Parallax, blur, desktop widget canvas. |

### Sidebars

| Module | Panel ID | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `sidebar/` | shared host | Physical left/right layer-shell hosts. They resolve semantic feature/system roles, own focus, masks, animations and live layout resize handles. |
| `sidebarLeft/` | `iiSidebarLeft` | Feature-role content: AI chat (Gemini/OpenAI/Ollama), YT Music player, Wallhaven browser, anime tracker, translator, draggable widgets and World Clock. The role can occupy either physical edge. |

| `ii/` | `iiOverlay` | Notification overlays and ii-specific UI elements. |
| `clipboard/` | `iiClipboard` | Clipboard history browser with search and image preview. `Ctrl+P` pins an entry to the top of the list; pins store their own decoded copy in `clipboard.pinned`, so they outlive the cliphist history. |

Hover the configured edge to open it, then hover a card to inspect that workspace. Shared with waffle. IPC target `workspaceStrip`. |
| `mascot/` | `iiMascotCompanion` | Playful full-body mascot companion: peeks from screen edges, reacts to shell events (music, battery, network, updates, notifications, screenshots, gaming, unlock), plays chase/hide-and-seek, and can physically interact with desktop widgets in chaos mode. Curated poses and per-surface overrides live in Settings › Mascot; a desktop widget variant lives in Settings › Widgets. Never over fullscreen, game mode, lock or session screens. Shared with waffle. IPC targets `mascot`, `mascotMood`. |

## Shared Infrastructure

### modules/common/ (~203 files)

The foundation everything else builds on.

| Component | What it is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Config.qml** | Configuration singleton. ~60 config sections. [Details](CONFIG_SYSTEM.md) |
| **Appearance.qml** | ii visual tokens. ~500 properties covering colors, rounding, typography, animation. |
| **Directories.qml** | Centralized path resolution. Config, cache, data, scripts, media directories. |
| **widgets/** | 130+ reusable widgets registered in `widgets/qmldir`. Layout, input, display, media, and specialized components. |
| **ThemePresets.qml** | 46 built-in theme presets. |
| **StylePresets.qml** | Style variant definitions. |

## Current notable modules

### Bar layout editor

The ii bar is driven by `Config.options.bar.layout`, split into five zones:

`left`, `centerLeft`, `center`, `centerRight`, `right`

The Settings page uses `BarModuleOrderEditor.qml` to reorder modules and drag available modules into zones. `workspaces` stays the centered pivot. The old `modulesLayout`, `edgeModulesLayout`, and `modulesPlacement` keys are deprecated compatibility baggage, not the runtime source of truth.

Migration `028-bar-modular-layout` exists but is disabled. The bar has a built-in classic fallback, so existing users do not need config rewrites just to update. Good. We learned.

### Screen Time

`services/ScreenTime.qml` tracks focused app usage when `sidebar.screenTime.enable` is true.

Visible surfaces:

- `modules/sidebarRight/screenTime/ScreenTimeWidget.qml`
- `modules/waffle/actionCenter/screenTime/ScreenTimePage.qml`

It stores local daily JSON under the iNiR state directory. It has daily totals, app totals, hourly buckets, and per-app hourly drill-down. It is off by default and hidden from sidebar layouts while disabled.

### World Clock

`modules/sidebarLeft/widgets/WorldClockWidget.qml` is a sidebar-left widget configured through `sidebar.widgets.worldClock_settings`.

If no timezones are configured, it suggests useful zones from the user's locale/system timezone. If the user configures timezones, Settings owns the explicit list and order.

### Shared panels

Some panels work under both families. They keep their `ii` prefix but load in waffle mode too:

`iiCheatsheet`, `iiOnScreenKeyboard`, `iiOverlay`, `iiOverview`, `iiRegionSelector`, `iiScreenCorners`, `iiWallpaperSelector`, `iiWallpaperLauncher`, `iiClipboard`, `iiRecordingOsd`, `iiWorkspaceStrip`, `iiMascotCompanion`

## For contributors

1. Read [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) to locate the module's place in the tree and its owning family
2. Identify which family owns the module before making visual changes
3. Use the correct token system: `Appearance.*` for ii, `Looks.*` for waffle
4. Register new panels in the appropriate panels file
5. Register new shared widgets in `modules/common/widgets/qmldir`
6. If touching shared modules, test under both families
